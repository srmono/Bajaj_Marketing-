  Business? Website

 Servers: 

  Web Servers, DB Servers,  1000gb  + 2000gb

  IT Resources
  Up and Running
  Scale 


Problems:
	Capital is high
	IT Eng
 	Up and Running
	Scale on Require/ondemand ?
        Serv1 / Resource


---------------------------------------------------

Cloud computing is a remote virtual pool of on demand shared resources

Compute storages
Databases
Network Services


Virtualization:
On Premise Data Centers
---------------------------------------


Cloud Computing

Compute: Compute objects prove the brains to process work load
Classic Environment: 
Ex: = CPU, RAM

Storage : Allows you to save and stor your data
Ex:- HDD, SDD, Network Attached Storage (NAS), Storage Area Network SAN, 

Database:
SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, NoSQL, Distributed DB

Network: resources provides the connectivity between resources
Ex:- Routers to route traffic between networks and switches

FireWalls ? allow or deny traffic into environment

Mahine Learning:   25% 
  Artificial Intelligence


--------------------------------

What is Cloud?

Cloud : 

@Workplace Data 

Cloud Deployment Models:

Public Cloud: 
A vendor makes available the use of shared infra , including:
compute, storage, databse, network

cloud vendor: AWS, Azure and GCP, IBM...
Power
Cooling
Hardware failure

Private Cloud?

on-premise 

Virtualization : create a pool of shared compute, storage and network

Bajaj:  Finance, Electric, .........

Hybrid Cloud?
Model that makes use of both Public and Private cloud?


Private cloud (compute)   ----------->   Public Cloud 

--------------------------
Security
Data Location ?
Capital Expenditure
Operational Expenditure
Tenancy

----------------------------------------

DevOps Tools and Flow
Kubernetes
Docker
Jenkins

Key cloud concepts
Web APP
On Demand resourcing: 

	App Service Resource : 200gb hdd, 2gb ram

Scalability: 
       App Service: Scale up and down 

Economy of scale:
 Traditional hosting 25k 50k 

Flexibility & Elasticity:
the amount of resources you required
resource: 3months
What scale

Growth: 


Utility based metering:


Shared Infrastructure:


Highly Available:


  Security: 
AWS
----------------------------------

Cloud Service Models

IaaS: Infrastructure as a service

hardware : os, network,..

configure / architect my own portion of cloud: 
virtual network
os, 


PaaS: Platform as a service

host hardware + os + network
network components
os

SaaS: Software as a service
Saas

hardware + os+ network + app functions and implement

mail.google.com

DRaaS
CaaS
MaaS
Monitoring as a Service

--------------------------------------------------------------


Why organization choose cloud?

ecom -> Big sale 
netstream: 

Traffic Bursting
Backup / DR:  policy: 30 days to archive
Web Hosting
CDN 
DNS
Test/Dev Environments

When purchage laptop/computer os,security : 1hr

minutes
POC : 
Idea ?

BigData/ Data Manipulation
----------------------------------------------------------

 How Data Center Architecture is reflected in the cloud

DC as a whole and its architecture can logically broken down as follows:

Location: Where Geographically located

Pysical Security: (External / Internal )

Mechanical & Exectrical Infrastructure (CRAC ( computer room air condition))

 Generators
 UPS
 CRAC
 Fire Suspension

Network Infrastructure (Switches/Routers/Firewalls)

VPC, subnets


Servers (Application/Directory/Database..)



Storage (NAS, SAN, Block storage, Backup)

AWS EBS 

cloud computing is based on _____________


 Management: 
Req, IT : Operations,
Develop : Developer

DevOps Culture


Horizontal scaling / Vertical scaling 

ec2 

DB: MySQL  rds
SDK: Node
Orc: EKS
